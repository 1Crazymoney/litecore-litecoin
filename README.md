litecore-litecoin [DEPRECATED]
=====================================

**Important Notice**: `litecore-litecoin` and the litecore stack are now deprecated.
Please switch to alternative packages. `libcore-litecoin` should be considered unsafe for production use.

Alternatives include: 
- Litecoin Core: I believe modern version of the Bitcore stack no longer need a modified version of the core client with additional rpcs to work. Please see Bitcore stack documentation.
